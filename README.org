* Expanse Guix channel
** Warning

This channel does not endorse any non-free application. We believe it is non-ethical, harmful to software development and restricts the users freedom. See the GNU philosophy for a more thorough discussion.

Those packages are provided as a last resort, should none of the official Guix packages work for you. You should understand the implication of using non-free software. Some of those implications include:

    Endorsement of non-free products and the perpetration of a culture of restriction on liberties.
    Non-free software cannot (or hardly) be audited: it can potentially spy on you, destroy or steal your data.

As a minimal security measure, itâ€™s heavily recommended to run any non-free software inside a container.

** Installation

  Nonguix can be installed as a [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Channels.html][Guix channel]]. To do so, add it to ~~/.config/guix/channels.scm~:
